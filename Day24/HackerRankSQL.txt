1. Query the Name of any student in STUDENTS who scored higher than  Marks. 
Order your output by the last three characters of each name. 
If two or more students both have names ending in the same last three characters 
(i.e.: Bobby, Robby, etc.), secondary sort them by ascending ID.

solution : select name 
           from students
           where marks > 75
           order by right(name, 3), id;


2.The total score of a hacker is the sum of their maximum scores for all of the challenges.
 Write a query to print the hacker_id, name, and total score of the hackers ordered by the
 descending score. If more than one hacker achieved the same total score, 
then sort the result by ascending hacker_id. 
Exclude all hackers with a total score of  from your result.

Solution: with tempCTE as (
    select h.hacker_id, h.name, MAX(s.Score) as Max_Score
    from hackers h 
    join submissions s on h.hacker_id = s.hacker_id
    group by h.hacker_id, h.name, s.challenge_id
)
select hacker_id, name, sum(Max_Score) as Total_Score
from tempCTE
group by hacker_id, name
having sum(Max_Score) > 0
order by sum(Max_Score) desc, hacker_id ;
